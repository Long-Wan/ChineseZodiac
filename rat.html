			<h2>Character of The Rat</h2>
			<p>
				Rats are quick-witted, resourceful and versatile.
				With strong intuition and quick response, they always easily adapt themselves to a new environment. With rich imaginations and sharp 
				observation, Rats can take advantage of various opportunities well. Rats have strong curiosity, so they tend to try their hands at 
				anything, and they can deal with it skillfully.
				Ladies belonging to the Rat zodiac sign are pretty, smart, and lovely. They have quick minds and dexterous hands, and are able to 
				learn anything.
				A lack of courage, as well as good command skills, Rats are not capable as leaders. Opportunistic and picky as Rats are, they do not 
				have broad minds, but a narrow view.
				Rats are kind, but sometimes impolite to others. People of the Rat zodiac sign usually sleep late, for mice are nocturnal animals.
